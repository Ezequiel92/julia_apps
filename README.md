# Collection of Julia scripts.

Collection of single-file apps written in Julia, for educational purposes.

- Each folder contains one .jl file with the script and the .toml files with the dependencies. 
- Each app is self-contained, and can be run as is.  
- The functions within each app are documented using docstrings. 
- An example on how to use the app is written at the end of each .jl file, and is what it is executed when the file in run. 

## Apps
